# An Analysis of NBA Ball Motion Data
<b>Team Duncan</b>: Patrick Vacek, Edie Espejo, Chirag Kashyap


## Major Goals
These goals are to be refined as we further explore these data.
<ol>
<li>Understand and recognize player actions based on ball data</li>
<li>Visualize games appropriately</li>
</ol>

## Data
15GB of ball motion data were downloaded online, then reformatted into separate .csv files per game.

## Project Updates
Here, we will be keeping track of updates and general notes as we proceed with our project timeline.

### 2017-06-07
<ul>
<li>Shot algorithm and machine learning method comparison is almost done</li>
<li>Dribbling will no longer be a main aspect of our project, but code exists</li>
<li>Passing is almost done, using gradient functions</li>
<li>Our final report is on the way!</li>
</ul>

### 2017-05-29
<ul>
<li>Function to find relative minima and maxima created</li>
<li>Fit polynomials to ball motion data</li>
<li>Pairwise plots of coefficients and features generated</li>
</ul>

### 2017-05-03
<ul>
<li>Information in .csv files for each game should be available by tomorrow</li>
<li>Exploratory analysis on ball motion for shots in 2016-01-01 CHA @ TOR (game_analysis.ipynb)</li>
</ul>

### 2017-04-18
<ul>
<li>Ball motion data was formatted into .csv format using bash scripts (playershot.csv)</li>
<li>Ball motion data from above .csv was visually explored (findshot.py)</li>
<li>We will be exploring the conversion of ball coordinates between our two datasets</li>
</ul>
